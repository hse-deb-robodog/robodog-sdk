# robodog-sdk

**The wire contract for the Robodog control system — and the way to build on it
without forking it.**

The Robodog stack is a set of independent processes talking over
[Eclipse Zenoh](https://zenoh.io): a bridge to the Unitree Go2 (or a MuJoCo
simulation of it), navigation, localization, teleoperation, safety. They are
coupled only through typed messages on well-known keys.

This package *is* that coupling. Install it, and your process is a peer of
every node in the stack — in your own repository, your own virtualenv, your own
process. You never clone the stack.

Built on [zenode](https://github.com/hse-deb-algo-athlets/zenode). Rationale
and the packaging decision: ADR-010 in the robodog-digipro repository.

## Install

```bash
uv add "robodog-sdk @ git+https://github.com/hse-deb-algo-athlets/robodog-sdk@v0.2.1"
```

Two dependencies (`zenode`, `pydantic`), no hardware or simulation packages.
It installs on any laptop in seconds.

## A first node

```python
from zenode import Node, run, subscribe
from robodog_sdk import OdometryState, RobotClient, StateTopics


class Wanderer(Node):
    name = "wanderer"

    async def on_start(self) -> None:
        self.robot = RobotClient(self)

    @subscribe(StateTopics.odometry, mode="latest")
    async def on_pose(self, msg: OdometryState) -> None:
        if msg.x > 2.0:
            self.robot.halt()


def cli() -> None:
    run(Wanderer)
```

```toml
# zenode.toml
[transport]
mode = "client"
connect = ["tcp/localhost:7447"]
namespace = "robodog"          # must be exactly this — see below
```

Bring up the stack (simulation, no robot needed), then run your node. To run
the simulated robot: see `sim/compose.yaml` and the Guide, chapter 2.

```bash
uv run wanderer
```

## The two ways in

**The contract** is the supported interface: `robodog_sdk.topics` binds every
key to its payload type, and `robodog_sdk.msgs` holds the schemas.

```python
from zenode import publish
from robodog_sdk import MotionTopics, MovementCommand

cmd = publish(MotionTopics.request)
cmd.put(MovementCommand(x=0.3))
```

**`RobotClient`** is a facade over exactly that — same keys, same priority, no
privileged access. It exists so a first node is short:

```python
async with robot.driving(x=0.3):
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # stops on the way out, always
```

Use whichever reads better. Dropping to the contract is not leaving the
supported path.

[`examples/`](examples/README.md) has the same node written both ways —
[`contract_drive.py`](examples/contract_drive.py) and
[`client_drive.py`](examples/client_drive.py). Diff them to see exactly what the
client does and does not do for you.
[`navigate.py`](examples/navigate.py) covers the task contract: submit, watch,
and handle each of the four ways a task can end.

See the whole contract without reading the source:

```bash
uv run zenode topics --contract robodog_sdk.topics
```

## Things that will bite you once

**Commands expire.** Movement keys carry `max_age = 0.3 s`, which is the
deadman: stop publishing and the robot stops. One `robot.move(...)` drives for
300 ms, not until you say otherwise. Use `robot.driving(...)`, or publish at
10 Hz yourself.

**Velocities are bounded.** `MovementCommand` enforces the robot's capability
envelope (`robodog_sdk.limits`), so an out-of-range value raises
`ValidationError` in *your* process rather than surprising anyone in the lab.
If a limit is wrong, fix it in `limits.py` — not by working around the model.

**You are not the only driver, and you do not ask to be.** Every source
publishes to one inlet and the motion gateway forwards whichever *fresh*
command carries the highest-ranking `MovementSource` —
`controller` > `assisted_teleop` > `planner` > `autonomous`. There is no lock to
take and none to release: priority rides on every frame, so a human touching the
gamepad wins instantly, and you resume by yourself when they stop. Read
`robot.preempted_by` if you want to know; ignoring it is also correct.

The corollary is that **`source` is not a label, it is the claim**. It defaults
to `autonomous`, the bottom rank. Setting it higher takes the robot away from
whoever that rank belongs to, so only set it if you are that thing.

**When commands go out and nothing moves, read `robot.state.gateway`.** The
gateway says who won (`active_source`), what it did to their command (`action`,
`active_zones`), and whether the winner went silent (`watchdog_tripped`). It is
the difference between debugging for an hour and reading one message. It is
published on every change and re-asserted about once a second, so a value going
stale means the gateway itself is gone.

`GatewayAction.stop` does not mean zero. A breached stop zone is *directional*:
only the velocity heading into the obstacle is stripped, so the robot can still
reverse or turn out of the zone. Only an obstacle that surrounds it, a stale
LiDAR scan or a tripped watchdog collapses the command entirely.

**Software can stop the robot; it cannot pretend to be the button.**
`robot.emergency_stop()` publishes the cancel event that the safety node, the
navigation coordinator and the fleet bridge each act on themselves — the robot
is zeroed, the running task is cancelled, the order runtime is wiped. It does
not *latch*, and there is no counterpart to it, because only the physical
switch latches and only the release press on the panel clears one.

**Ask `robot.motion_permitted()`, not `state.safety.value.estop`.** The latch
drops one phase before the robot can actually move — deliberately, so the
bridge can start standing it back up — and `motion_permitted` is the field that
closes that gap. It also fails safe on silence: a safety latch that stopped
arriving reads exactly like one that says stopped, which is why it takes a
freshness window rather than being a property.

**Navigation is a task, not a command.** `await robot.navigate_to(2.0, 0.5)`
submits a goal, gets an id back, and returns the `TaskResult` that id ends on —
which can be `SUCCEEDED`, `BLOCKED`, `FAILED` or `CANCELED`. Only the first is
arrival, and `BLOCKED` is not an error: the robot met the world and stopped.
Check the result, do not assume it.

**A map-frame coordinate is only valid while the map is.** If you store a
pose and drive to it later, store `robot.map_id()` beside it and refuse the
coordinate when the ids differ — nothing in a bare pose says which map it came
from, so a rebuilt or re-sessioned map turns every saved coordinate into a
confident drive to the wrong place. `map_id()` returns `None` for "no usable
map" (SLAM down, odometry fallback, or nothing published), which never means
"unchanged".

**A task's lifecycle and what the skill is doing are different questions.**
`TaskFeedback.state` is `RUNNING` for the whole task and never anything else —
the terminal verdict lives only on the result key, so the two can never
disagree. What moves is `activity`: `cruising`, `aligning`, `stalled`,
`retreating`. A stall is transient and the skill is still trying; only a
`TaskResult` carrying `BLOCKED` means it gave up.

**A task you are not watching is discarded on an e-stop.** That is the default,
and it is the right one for a goal sent from a script: nobody wants a route
resuming itself minutes after a human walked over and hit the button. Pass
`on_estop=EstopPolicy.HOLD` only if this process owns the mission and is still
there to handle the recovery.

**Asking after a task the stack has forgotten raises.** `task_status()` answers
with a real state for a task the coordinator remembers — including `RUNNING`
for one still under way, so check `state.is_terminal` — and raises
`ServiceError` for one it has never heard of or has since evicted. "Unknown" is
not a lifecycle state and the contract will not invent one.

**One task at a time.** There is no queue. A goal submitted while the robot is
navigating is *refused* unless you pass `preempt=True`, which cancels the
running task first. Refusal raises `PermissionError` from `navigate_to`; if you
would rather branch than catch, use `robot.submit()` and read `handle.accepted`.

**The namespace must match the deployment.** Keys in the contract are relative;
`[transport] namespace` is prefixed at runtime, so `system_state/odometry`
becomes `robodog/system_state/odometry`. Everything talking to one robot uses
that robot's namespace — set it to anything else and you will see no data at
all, with no error. It is the first thing to check when nothing arrives, and
`uv run zenode nodes` shows whether you are looking in the right place.

Today that means **`namespace = "robodog"`, and nothing else**: the stack still
hard-codes the prefix into its own key strings rather than deriving it from a
namespace, so an isolated sandbox under `robodog/team-03` would talk to itself
and to nothing on the robot. Deriving it is a change pending on the stack side.

## Tracing

Your node is traced whether or not you ask for it, and that is the point: when
a command goes out and nothing moves, the question spans four processes.

A trace starts at the topics that begin a causal chain —
`system_state/odometry` and `localization/pose`, both sampled at 1 % — and
follows the data from there.
**Everything your handler causes stays in that trace automatically**: `put()`,
`await self.call()`, `self.spawn()` and `await self.blocking()`. There is
nothing to configure and no API to learn.

A service call is not a trace root: it joins the caller's trace, or none. So a
navigation task submitted from a script has no trace of its own, while one
submitted from inside a handler belongs to the trace of whatever triggered it.

Follow one message across the fleet:

```bash
uv run zenode logs --trace <id>    # every log record from that chain
uv run zenode trace <id>           # the path it took, hop by hop
```

Both work with nothing installed and no collector running. Spans are optional
(`zenode[otel]`); without them a traced `put()` costs about 3.6 µs against
1.9 µs untraced, and untraced topics are unaffected either way.

### The one thing to watch: timers break the chain

A timer body is caused by the clock, not by a message, so it runs outside any
trace. The common sense-then-act shape therefore loses the link:

```python
@subscribe(StateTopics.odometry, mode="latest")
async def on_pose(self, msg):
    self.latest = msg


@every(0.1)
async def tick(self):
    self.cmd.put(...)  # orphaned — no link to the pose that caused it
```

Capture the context in the handler and restore it before publishing:

```python
from zenode import trace


@subscribe(StateTopics.odometry, mode="latest")
async def on_pose(self, msg):
    self.latest = (msg, trace.current())


@every(0.1)
async def tick(self):
    msg, traceparent = self.latest
    with trace.using(traceparent):
        self.cmd.put(...)
```

[`examples/contract_drive.py`](examples/contract_drive.py) does exactly this.

The same applies to `RobotClient.driving()`: its republish pump is clock-driven,
so those commands are not linked to a measurement either. Use `robot.move()`
inside a handler when you want the causal chain preserved.

### Declaring your own topics

`trace=` is yours to set on topics you declare. Mark the topic that *starts* a
chain, and sample it if it is a stream:

```python
class MyTopics(TopicSet):
    detections = Topic("perception/detections", Detection, trace=True, trace_ratio=0.05)
```

Marking a downstream topic as well is harmless — a topic starts a trace only
when none is active, so a pipeline stays one trace. It does mean `trace_ratio`
only takes effect on whichever topic actually started it.

## Testing without a robot

`robodog_sdk.testing` plays the other side of the conversation: `FakeStack` for
latched state and a record of everything your node tried to drive, and `FakeNav`
for navigation — it accepts goals, streams feedback, and ends a task wherever you
tell it to, so the `BLOCKED` branch of your code gets exercised without needing
an obstacle. `nav.activity = NavActivity.STALLED` makes the skill appear to
stall mid-task without one either.

`stack.set_driver(...)` fakes a human grabbing the gamepad or a collision zone
firing, and `stack.set_safety(...)` fakes the e-stop — a pressed button, or the
safety source going quiet, which stops just as hard for an entirely different
reason. All of it is otherwise hard to arrange on a desk. With `zenode.testing`,
the whole thing runs in-process — no router, no network.

```python
async with harness() as h:
    stack = await h.start_node(FakeStack)
    agent = await h.start_node(MyAgent)

    stack.set_battery(soc=5, level=BatteryLevel.critical)
    await asyncio.sleep(0.2)

    assert stack.stopped
```

It is a stand-in, not a simulator — nothing moves. For "does the robot actually
get there", run the MuJoCo simulation.

## Versioning

Semantic versioning, `0.x` while the contract settles: minor versions may move
keys. Pin a tag. `CONTRACT_VERSION` is reported on each node's health
heartbeat, so a skew between your project and the deployed stack shows up in
`zenode health` instead of as a parse error somewhere else.
