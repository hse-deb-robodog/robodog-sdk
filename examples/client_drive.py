"""Drive forward a fixed distance, using ``RobotClient``.

    uv run python examples/client_drive.py

Equivalent to ``contract_drive.py``. The client supplies ``driving()``
(republishes at 10 Hz, stops on exit), ``state`` (latched pose and its age)
and ``preempted_by`` (who outranks us at the gateway).

Distance is measured against ``state.odometry`` rather than
``state.localization``: the fused pose jumps when SLAM corrects, which reads
here as having driven backwards.

The drive runs as a background task because decorated bindings are wired only
after ``on_start`` returns.
