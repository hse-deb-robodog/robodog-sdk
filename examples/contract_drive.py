"""Drive forward a fixed distance, using the contract directly.

    uv run python examples/contract_drive.py

Equivalent to ``client_drive.py``, written against ``Topic`` declarations
rather than :class:`~robodog_sdk.RobotClient`. Handled explicitly here:

- Republishing. A command expires after ``COMMAND_MAX_AGE``, so sustained
  motion needs a timer rather than a single ``put()``.
- Stopping on shutdown, in ``on_stop``; without it the robot runs until the
  deadman elapses.
- The command's rank, carried on every frame as ``source=autonomous``.
- Trace continuity. ``system_state/odometry`` is a trace root, but a timer
  body runs outside any trace, so the pose's context is captured in the
  handler and restored before publishing.
